#3 If you could change 1 thing about your favorite framework/language/platform (pick one), what would it be?

Based on my limited experience, my favorite framework is spring boot.
One change I would consider is to make its Documentation more beginner friendly.
People would be able to pick it up more easily and would expand its use among developers.
